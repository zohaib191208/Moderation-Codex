# Moderation-Codex
Hi, this is for the newcomers! (or if your already mod) and if you're reading this, it means you've been selected to join our moderation team!
Firstly we would like to congratulate you on landing this position!, remember make sure to be active and helping out!
This codex is a brief description on your responsibilites of being a moderator and what to do in certain types of situations.
Most importantly, remember to always follow the rules the same as members and NOT abuse your powers!
## Moderation (bot) Commands.
1. `Mute/Timeout`
- This mutes a specific user.
- Make sure to inclue the duration.
- If a user is unmuted and they're still doing something they shouldnt be doing, you can mute them for longer.
- Make sure to include a reason.
2. `Ban`
- This permanantly bans a user for breaking a important rule in the server.
- Remember, only use this if absolutely necessary.
- Make sure to include a reason.
3. `Kick`
- This kicks a user from the server.
- The user could join back if they wanted to.
- Make sure to include a reason.
## Punishments
1. Keep punishments fair. Do NOT abuse them.
2. Punish someone in the same channel, so that we could see what happened, do it in the same channel they were misbehaving in.
3. If a user starts complaining in dms whether it was a ban, mute or kick just simply block them or warn them that they'll get a worse punishment.
## Piracy
Its a STRAIGHT ban whether someone has a pirated verison of security breach, piracy is strictly a ban and is a IMPORTANT rule in this server, it is illegal.
If your helping someone and you think they have a pirated version plus having issues dealing with their problem, please make sure to ask if they have a pirated version.
They'll most likely say yes due to how many people not read the rules.
Ban them if they do have a pirated version. Please include this reason in your ban.
## Support/tickets
Someone will open a ticket whether its support, bugs or suggestions.
1. `Support ticket`
- Someone will most likely open a ticket for support and try your best into helping them.
- Make sure to always ask if they haeve a new version of the sbmp launcher.
- If you feel you cant help this person or your having issues trying to help a person, ping/wait for another support/mod to come in and help the person.
- If you feel that the person has a pirated version, please ask them if they do and if you feel like they are lying, tell them to link their steam account or send a screenshot.
- If they're using both skizzium and sbmp launcher, its preferably good to try to fix their issue with the sbmp one first, then if it doesent work try to fix the skizzium launcher issue.
- If a user asks support for them glitching into other places and breaking the game and asking for help to get out of that space, simply do not help them. It is most likely that they purposely glitched in areas they arent supposed to be in.
- Make sure to ask for some of the details about their issue.
2. `Bugs/Glitches ticket`
- If someone opens this ticket just ask them what the bug is, etc.
- Make sure to ask them for proof VIA video/screenshot.
- If its a glitch that they've done on purpose simply dont help them.
- Once they've provided enough proof make sure to make a note on it and notify the devs/spooks about it.
- Before reporting a bug, check the trello to see if someone else has reported the same bug as you, if not then your alright to report your bug.
3. `Suggestions ticket`
- If someone opens a suggestion ticket ask them details and information about the suggestion.
- If you think the suggestion is good enough, you could talk about it to a staff member or higher and just maybe itll get added.
- Obviously if someone is making a joke suggestion just close the ticket and tell them to not do it again
- Make sure they explain why the suggestion is good and important and why it would benefit the server.
## Issues
### Spam
If someone is spamming just mute them for 5-10 mins, if they carry on mute them for longer and if they keep carrying on it'll result into a further punishment.
### Advertisements
If someone is self advertising or advertising something else, delete their message and tell them to stop and mute them. They should ask a staff member if they are allowed to advertise and shouldnt be advertising if havent been granted permission. Obviously if they carry on then it would be a further punishment.
### Toxicity/Racisim etc.
If you catch someone being racist or being toxic for no reason just mute them for a long time. Racisim is tolerated and should no way be used for no reason or using it in an argument. Speaking of arugments, if people are arguing and taking it too far simply tell them to stop. If they carry on mute them for 10 minutes and if they still carry on it'll result in a further punishment. Same goes to other stuff like sexisim etc.
### Mod abuse/Power abuse
If a mod for example is abusing their power, tell them to stop. If they are still carrying on, let an admin or higher role know. Moderators followe the rules exactly the same as members, just because your a moderator doesent mean you shouldnt follow certain rules.
