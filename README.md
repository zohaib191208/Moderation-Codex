# Moderation-Codex
Hi, this is for the newcomers! (or if your already mod) and if you're reading this, it means you've been selected to join our moderation team!
Firstly we would like to congratulate you on landing this position!, remember make sure to be active and helping out!
This codex is a brief description on your responsibilites of being a moderator and what to do in certain types of situations.
Most importantly, remember to always follow the rules the same as members and NOT abuse your powers!
## Moderation (bot) Commands.
1. `-Mute <User:Mention/ID> <Duration:Duration> <Reason:Text>`
- This mutes a specific user.
- Make sure to inclue the duration, should look something like "1d" days = d, months = m, years = y.
- If a user is unmuted and they're still doing something they shouldnt be doing, you can mute them for longer.
- Make sure to include a reason.
2. `Ban <User:Mention/ID> [Reason:Text], [-d d:Duration - Duration],  [-ddays ddays:Whole number - Delete Days]`
- This permanantly bans a user for breaking a important rule in the server.
- Remember, only use this if absolutely necessary.
- Make sure to include a reason.
3. `Kick <User:Mention/ID> [Reason:Text]`
- This kicks a user from the server.
- The user could join back if they wanted to.
- Make sure to include a reason.
## Punishments
1. Keep punishments fair. Do NOT abuse them.
2. Punish someone in the same channel, so that we could see what happened, do it in the same channel they were misbehaving in.
3. If a user starts complaining in dms whether it was a ban, mute or kick just simply block them or warn them that they'll get a worse punishment.
## Piracy
Its a STRAIGHT ban whether someone has a pirated verison of security breach, piracy is strictly a ban and is a IMPORTANT rule in this server, it is illegal.
If your helping someone and you think they have a pirated version plus having issues dealing with their problem, please make sure to ask if they have a pirated version.
They'll most likely say yes due to how many people not read the rules.
Ban them if they do have a pirated version. Please include this reason in your ban.
## Support/tickets
Someone will open a ticket whether its support, bugs or suggestions.
1. `Support ticket`
- Someone will most likely open a ticket for support and try your best into helping them.
- Make sure to always ask if they haeve a new version of the sbmp launcher.
- If you feel you cant help this person or your having issues trying to help a person, ping/wait for another support/mod to come in and help the person.
- If you feel that the person has a pirated version, please ask them if they do and if you feel like they are lying, tell them to link their steam account or send a screenshot.
- If they're using both skizzium and sbmp launcher, its preferably good to try to fix their issue with the sbmp one first, then if it doesent work try to fix the skizzium launcher issue.
- If a user asks support for them glitching into other places and breaking the game and asking for help to get out of that space, simply do not help them. It is most likely that they purposely glitched in areas they arent supposed to be in.
- Make sure to ask for some of the details about their issue.
